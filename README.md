# Calculator Project

This project is a simulation of a calculator that can handle various mathematical operations including addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), division (/), exponentiation (^), and supports decimal numbers and parentheses. The calculator converts mathematical expressions into postfix form using a stack data structure and evaluates them step-by-step, ensuring proper handling of operator precedence and parentheses.

## Key Features
- **Basic Operations:** Supports addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and exponentiation.
- **Decimal Numbers:** Handles floating-point numbers and maintains accuracy with decimal operations.
- **Parentheses Handling:** Uses a custom stack implementation to manage parentheses and operator precedence.
- **Expression Tree:** Converts the input expression into an expression tree and displays it.
- **Error Handling:** Detects and manages errors in expressions, such as incorrect parentheses placement or operator misuse.
- **Step-by-Step Evaluation:** Prints the step-by-step evaluation of the expression during calculation.

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Language:** CPP
- **Data Structures:** Custom stack implementation, expression tree

## How to Use
1. Input a mathematical expression using standard operators (+, -, *, /, ^) and parentheses.
2. The calculator will convert the expression to postfix notation, evaluate it, and print each step of the calculation.
3. If the expression contains errors, the calculator will display an error message and handle it accordingly.



This project demonstrates the use of data structures like stacks and trees to handle complex mathematical expression evaluations while providing robust error management.
